# SQL-HealthcareDB-project
This project demonstrates my ability to create, manage and query a relational database management system (pgSQL). The database simulates a
hospital management system and has been populated with synthetic data to mimic real-world scenarios.

Additionally, I connected to the "HealthcareDB" database in PostgreSQL from my R Jupyter Notebook, and performed exploratory data analysis on the database, answering critical business intelligence questions that a healthcare organization might have. This includes revenue trends, patient demographics, and appointment insights, thus showcasing my SQL skills, and ability to integrate SQL with R for data analysis and visualization.
